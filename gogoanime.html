<h1>Top 5 Best Harem Anime - Gogoanime</h1>
<p>Harem is a very popular genre, which can be considered as one of the main IP lines of the anime industry. There, the work often builds a group of many characters who share a close relationship with the main character. Here are the top 5 best harem anime <a href="https://gogoanime.studio/">Gogoanime</a>.</p>
<h3>Isekai no seikishi monogatari</h3>
<p>When you want an anime that's entertaining enough to watch, but doesn't lose any of the tight character of a serious plot, then Isekai no seikishi monogatari is a solid choice. The special thing that makes it attractive compared to the genre, is the attention to world-building and harmoniously combining the context of school life with action and fantasy.</p>
<p>In other words, the anime is very careful with the content, while the fanservice elements are never left out or overly cautious in order to please the viewers &ndash; a remarkable thing when it is oriented to the masses like A delicious cake at the party. One could easily forgive the greasiness knowing it was here for the fun of it.</p>
<h3>Saber Marionette J</h3>
<p>Looking back at the time when the harem was still in its infancy, Saber Marionette J appeared unbelievably neat and bold even though it was original. Anime retains the typical materials of Japanese culture in a sci-fi setting in the distant future, allowing serious and casual elements to coexist to take the work away from being "only girls". and then no one remembers anything. This is the favorite anime on <a href="https://gogoanime.studio/">Gogoanime.studio</a>.</p>
<p>The story of robot girls with emotions in the middle of a world full of men could not have been a more effective platform for Saber Marionette to develop the three female leads. Free-spirited, fun, and intense when needed, it maximizes the emotion of anime through beautiful dramas without sacrificing any of the character's personality. When this genre always impresses with quantity over quality, a good original work like this is a luxury.</p>
<h3>Martian Successor Nadesico</h3>
<p>This may not be the best anime, but enjoying a work that confidently aligns the harem with space opera, while at the same time refraining from fanservice like this is always fun for serious fans.</p>
<p>Especially in harem, a segment that is not necessarily lacking in charm but lacking in distinct storylines, an anime like Nadesico is all the more worthy of respect. It has a smart direction by an enthusiastic writer with serious content and an emphasis on sci-fi logic.</p>
<p>But all are well mixed with comedy to make everything easy to breathe, on the other hand, dare to blatantly parody the senior mecha anime. It's a bravery we usually only see in much older works like Martian Successor Nadesico.</p>
<h3>Utawarerumono</h3>
<p>Utawarerumono is a rare anime adaptation of a good quality visual novel. When there are so many interesting harem works that adorn their surface with beautiful girls and easy plots that lose their depth, Utawarerumono is a typical example of steadfastly building the plot of the book. suction is before and after. Revolving around the journey of Hakuoru standing up to lead the villagers against the tyrant who is ruling the country, the anime takes the content as the card frame and the harem element as a supplement.</p>
<p>As a result, the harem becomes a natural part of the story without causing the audience to get lost on screen for a moment. Besides, the combination of fantasy, history and science fiction makes the anime more attractive.</p>
<h3>Seto no Hanayome</h3>
<p>The content sounds like cane sugar because of the opening act "hero saves the mermaid" of the boy Nagasumi, but after only a few minutes, it showed a disgusting face when the development gradually deviated from expectations. wait for the viewer. Seto no Hanayome is passionate about preventing the male lead from coming to the beautiful harem of his life and enjoys whirling parody of "people's anime".</p>
<p>With shows that rely entirely on comedy for this long, it's usually mid-season that the laughter starts to run out. However, Seto no Hanayome still retains its attractive momentum like a magnet and does not let its jokes become old. Although the harem factor here is not too prominent, the excellent cast of characters and clever way of building situations will keep you from beginning to end.</p>
